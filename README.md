# kMean & Regression
## Task 1 - Image Segmentation with kMeans
This program is located in the segmentationKMeans.ipynb file. It takes in an image and computes [posterisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterization) on the image to transform the image.
To compute the posterisation, I designed my own kMean function (rather than using sklearn's).

## Task 2 - Linear Regression

## Task 3 - Linear Regression using RANSAC

## Setup
Load the desired file in Jupyter Notebook and restart to run each program.
